## LumEngine is an open-source game engine developed by a single indie developer.

## (ASSUMPTIONS)
It focuses on old-school rendering techniques and shaders, making it perfect for creating retro-style games.
The engine provides a user-friendly API and editor, while giving developers full low-level control over rendering, logic, and systems.
LumEngine is built for developers who want to understand and control every part of what they create.
